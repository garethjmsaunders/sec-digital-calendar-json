# SEC digital calendar JSON

This long-term project is a work-in-progress to represent the SEC digital calendar and lectionary in JSON format (an open standard file format and data interchange format).

The first step is to decide on data schemas to represent

* Readings (Years A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2) -- IN PROGRESS
* Church year
* Saints days and minor festivals
* Bishops' ordinations
* Special occasions (Mothering Sunday, days before Ascention Day, Remembrance Sunday, Ember Days)

My long term goal is to use this data to drive the SEC Calendar and Lectionary website (https://seccalendar.org.uk) and also automatically generate the digital version of the calendar each year. This is the first step.
